# C-Program-for-Logic-Proposition-correctitude
I made a C++ Program wich tells if a logic proposition is a well formed propositional formula.
The program can also make a very simple truthtable only between two variables and one connective.

!!! RULES: This program tells if a proposition is correct with no mistakes and also creates a simple truth table for only two variables and a connective. ex: P AND Q - in other instances it is incorrect

Note: Propositions must be written with a space between every character, all in CAPS and connectives are in this form: AND, OR, IMPLIES, EQUIVALENT and also NOT.
Program also has explanations written along code.

example: ( ( P IMPLIES Q ) AND NOT R ) OR P
